# Specific Test IV. Diffusion Models 


Task: Develop a generative model to simulate realistic strong gravitational lensing images. Train a diffusion model (DDPM) to generate lensing images. You are encouraged to explore various architectures and implementations within the diffusion model framework. Please implement your approach in PyTorch or Keras and discuss your strategy.
