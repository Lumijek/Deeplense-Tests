# Deeplense-Tests

These are my files and results for Common Test I. Multi-Class Classification and Specific Test IV. Diffusion Models.

The main project I would like to particiate in for GSOC is [Diffusion Models for Gravitational Lensing Simulation](https://ml4sci.org/gsoc/2024/proposal_DEEPLENSE5.html).

Due to the large model size, I have stored the model weights using [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/).
To get them please follow the instructions to download Git LFS from the website and then run `git lfs pull`.

Each folder will then contain:
1. An `ipynb` file showing the overall code and process used to build and train the model
2. A `.pt` file which contains the weights
3. The README.md with my test results
4. `output-log.txt` which shows the the loss alongside several other metrics for the whole training process
