Each folder will then contain:


Deeplense-Tests
These are my files and results for Common Test I. Multi-Class Classification and Specific Test IV. Diffusion Models.

The main project I would like to particiate in for GSOC is Diffusion Models for Gravitational Lensing Simulation.

Due to the large model size, I have stored the model weights using Git LFS. To get them please follow the instructions to download Git LFS from the website and then run git lfs pull.

Each folder will then contain:

An ipynb file showing the overall code and process used to build and train the model
A .pt file which contains the weights
The README.md with my test results
output-log.txt which shows the the loss alongside several other metrics for the whole training process
